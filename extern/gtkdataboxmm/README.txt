GtkDataboxMM

The gtkdataboxmm C++ binding provides a C++ interface on top of the
gtkdatabox C library.

GtkDatabox is a widget for live display of large amounts of fluctuating
numerical data. Data presentation (e.g. on linear or logarithmic
scales, as dots or lines, with markers/labels) as well as user
interaction (e.g. measuring distances) is easy.
