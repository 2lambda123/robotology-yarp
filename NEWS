INTRODUCTION
------------

This is YARP2, a new version of the YARP robot library set.

It helps do stuff with robots (or avoid doing stuff with robots by 
spending your time writing libraries).

License and copyright information is in COPYING.

STATUS
------

YARP2 is usable by brave developers.  Watch out for the following:

+ compared to YARP1, there are a lot of missing parts.  The library
  in src/libYARP_OS_compat will help if you want to mingle new and old.

+ yarp::sig::Image is a stub - it has a very bare minimum of functionality.
  You can still use YARPImage; the classes are network compatible.

+ yarp::os::Bottle doesn't have everything that YARPBottle had.  You can
  still use YARPBottle; the classes are network compatible.

+ libYARP_OS - fairly complete
+ libYARP_OS_compat - fairly complete
+ libYARP_sig - a stub
+ libYARP_sig_compat - a stub
