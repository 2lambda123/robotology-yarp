Important Changes
-----------------

* Optional dependency on YCM now requires version 0.8.1 or later.

Bug Fixes
---------

### Build System

* Fixed issue with vtk config files when looking for the `pcl` component.
* Fixed java bindings.
* Fixed static builds.
* Added components for private libraries (needed for static builds)
* Added components for yarpcar and yarpmod.
* When using YARP_MODULE_PATH a deprecation warning is printed (YCM should
  be used instead).
* Deprecation warnings when calling `find_package(YARP)` more than once are no
  longer printed.
* Fix configuration when `YARP_COMPILE_CARRIER_PLUGINS` and
  `YARP_COMPILE_DEVICE_PLUGINS` is set to OFF.
* When using `FeatureSummary`, `find_package(YARP)` adds the `DESCRIPTION` and
  `URL` properties.
* When using `FeatureSummary`, `find_package(YARP)` no longer adds `YCM` to the
  optional dependencies.
* Fixed behavior of `OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS` in `find_package(YARP)` calls when
  the `REQUIRED` option was passed on. Now, a YARP bundle will be considered
  not found if any of such components is missing.

### Libraries

#### YARP_OS

* Fixed SharedLibraryClass::getContent(). Now a const and a non const version
  are available.
* Fixed SharedLibraryClassFactory::destroy(). Now it is const like create().

#### YARP_math

* Fixed a regression in the build system that prevented YARP from being
  compiled if Eigen3 was available.

#### YARP_pcl

* Fixed missing isDense parmeter.

#### YARP_sig

* Fixed negative vocab(#1749).

### GUIs

#### yarpscope

* Fixed double free during the closure. It has been introduced by #1685
  (commit 02abf63).
