========================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+v2.3.72.1%22).

Bug Fixes
---------

### Build System

* Fixed build with CMake < 3.4

### CMake Modules

* Removed `IMPORTED_GLOBAL` property from `YarpOSXUtilities.cmake`.

### Libraries

#### `YARP_sig`

* Fixed bug in `yarp::sig::Sound::operator+=`

#### `YARP_dev`

* ControlBoardWrapper now correctly passes on any monitoring to wrapped
  subdevices.
* Subdevices wrapped by ControlBoardWrapper are now identified by their actual
  name by the monitor object, that is, their name will be displayed on the
  command line if `yarpdev` was called with `--verbose`.
  Previously, it used a generic "subdevice" identifier.
* Added missing `IFrameGrabberControl2` to `RGBDSensorWrapper`.
* Fixed `RGBDSensorWrapper` compatibilty with `frameGrabberGui2`.
* Fixed joint remapping in method `getRefVelocity()`.

#### `YARP_serversql`

* Added check if `rossrv`, `tcpros` and `xmlrpc` are installed when
yarpserver is launched with `--ros` option. (#722)


#### `YARP_OS`

* Added timeout parameter in `TcpConnector::connect()` to unify behaviour with the
  `ACE_SOCK_Connector`.

### GUIs

#### yarpscope

* Fixed bottle handling.

#### yarpmanager

* Added `checkNetwork` before contacting the nameserver.(#1536)
* Added the ping on `yarprun` nodes.
* Fixed mismatch of port connections when not ordered by ID.(#964)
* Fixed mismatch of resources when not ordered by ID

### Devices

#### `ControlBoardRemapper`

* Fixed `getEncoderAccelerations()` method.

#### `depthCamera`

* Fixed find OpenNI2 in CMakelists.txt.

#### `AnalogWrapper`

* Fixed issue preventing publication of FT sensor data to ROS.


### Bindings

* Fixed out of source builds.
* Added `SWIG_PREPROCESSOR_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS` to avoid the SWIG preprocessor from
  parsing `VOCAB`. This avoids hacks required for compilation of bindings (hacks
  removed), and enables the correct generation of `VOCAB`s inside `enum`s.
* Added `test_vocab.lua` to catch regressions on `VOCAB` in the future.
* Rename `test_string.lua` to more representative `test_port.lua`, enable it to
  run without the `yarpserver`.
