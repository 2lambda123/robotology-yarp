### Libraries

#### `YARP_dev`

* yarp::dev::IMap2D::clear() method renamed to yarp::dev::IMap2D::clearAllMaps().

* yarp::dev::INavigation2DControlActions. The following methods have been added:
  getAllNavigationWaypoints(std::vector<yarp::dev::Map2DLocation>& waypoints)
  getCurrentNavigationWaypoint(yarp::dev::Map2DLocation& curr_waypoint)
  getCurrentNavigationMap(yarp::dev::NavigationMapTypeEnum map_type, yarp::dev::MapGrid2D& map)
* yarp::dev::INavigation2DTargetActions. The following method has been added:
  gotoTargetByRelativeLocation(double x, double y)
* The following method now accepts a parameter (with default value = infinite
  for backward compatibility):

  bool   getLocalizationStatus(LocalizationStatusEnum& status)
  bool   getEstimatedPoses(std::vector<yarp::dev::Map2DLocation>& poses)
