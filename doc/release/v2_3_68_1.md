YARP 2.3.68.1 (UNRELEASED) Release Notes
========================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+2.3.68.1%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

* `YARP_gsl` was removed the `YARP_LIBRARIES` CMake variable where it was
  erroneously added. If you are using that library you might need to add
  `YARP::YARP_gsl` to the list of libraries linked by your target.

### Devices

#### depthCamera

* Spelling of the `length`-related parameters was fixed. You might have to fix
  your configuration files.


New Features
------------

### Build System

* Builds from git repositories will now contain the git commit and dirty state
  in the version number (For example 2.3.68+98-20161222.4+git3942468+dirty
  (2.3.68+98)). `YARP_VERSION_MAJOR`, `YARP_VERSION_MINOR`, `YARP_VERSION_PATCH`
  and `YARP_VERSION_TWEAK` meanings hasn't changed. `YARP_VERSION_STRING` was
  removed since it was never used.

### Devices

* Added new `laserFromDepth` device.


Bug Fixes
---------

### Build System

* Fixed `YARP_CLEAN_API` build with GCC 6.1 or later (that uses c++14 by
  default) by forcing `-std=c++98` (#978).
* Fixed `YARP_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX11` on MSVC 12 2013.


### CMake Modules

* Fixed issues in yarp_add_idl() when generating files using paths
  containing `..`


### Libraries

#### YARP_OS

* fixed typo preventing successful compilation on linux/mac with C++11 enabled.

#### YARP_dev

* Added warning when loading a plugin with a wrong library parameter (#975).


### Private libraries

#### YARP_manager

* Fixed typo in `setEnvironemnt`, now `setEnvironment`


### GUIs

#### yarpmanager

* Remove extra ';' from enviornment variables and port prefix (#980, #982).

#### yarplaserscannergui

* Fixed close button not closing the gui (#720).
* Fixed laser orientation to have x axis pointing towards N and y axis towards
  W (as in ROS)


### Devices

* Fixed `rangeFinder2DClient` and `getLaserMeasurement()` function of various
  hardware devices: laser_angle_of_view was not computed correctly.

#### fakeMotionControl

* Fixed error in open function.
* Better param check.

#### depthCamera

* Added missing distortion model params.
* Implemented camInfo messages for ros interoperation.
* Fixed parsing file error.
* Cleanup and improved documentation.
* Fixed segmentation fault on device shutdown.
* Fixed segmentation fault when passing an incorrect configuration.

#### fakeLaser

* Improved fakeLaser test to display x and y axis

#### rangeFinder2DWrapper

* Added internal subdevice spawn and attach.
* Fixed parameter name in error message.

#### rpLidar

* Allow to set negative max_angle & min_angle, allowing a virtual rotation of
  the sensor zero (#1019).
