YARP 2.3.68.1 (UNRELEASED) Release Notes
========================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+2.3.68.1%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

* `YARP_gsl` was removed the `YARP_LIBRARIES` CMake variable where it was
  erroneously added. If you are using that library you might need to add
  `YARP::YARP_gsl` to the list of libraries linked by your target.

Bug Fixes
---------

### Build System

* Fix `YARP_CLEAN_API` build with GCC 6.1 or later (that uses c++14 by default)
  by forcing `-std=c++98` (#978).


### Private libraries

#### YARP_manager

* Fixed typo in `setEnvironemnt`, now `setEnvironment`
