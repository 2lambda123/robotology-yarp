#### `yarpmotorgui`

* Added an alternative visualization to the tree view on the left of the ``yarpmotorgui``. It is a ``Widget`` visualization with the flow layout. In this way, it is possible to see the status of all the joints in a single screen. The widgets have a context menu to idle, run and home joints. When double-clicking a joint, it highlights the corresponding widget on the right panel. When double-clicking on the part name, it moves to the corresponding tab.
