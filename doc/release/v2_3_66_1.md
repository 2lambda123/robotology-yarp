Important Changes
-----------------

### YARP_dev

* The `analogServer` device (implemented in `yarp::dev::AnalogWrapper` has removed
  the supporte for the `deviceId` parameter, that has been
  deprecated since 2014. Invalid configuration files of the form:
~~~
robotName icub
deviceId left_arm
~~~
  can be updated with the valid:
~~~
name /icub/left_arm/analog:o
~~~

* The `controlboardwrapper2` device (implemented in `yarp::dev::ControlBoardWrapper` has removed
  the supported for the `threadrate` parameter, that has been deprecated since 2014.
  Invalid configuration files of the form `threadrate 10` can be update with the valid form `period 10`.

Bug Fixes
---------

### YARP_OS

* Fixed `PlatformThread` for OSX, no ACE, no c++11.
* Fixed memory leak in `SharedLibrary`.
* Fixed memory leak in `Property::fromArgs`.
* Use reentrant version of `get_host_addr` in `NameConfig` and
  `SocketTwoWayStream` (fixes a few possible race conditions).
* Fixed memory leak in `NameConfig::getHostName` with `SKIP_ACE` enabled.
* Fixed "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value" issues
  reported by `valgrind --memcheck` in `SocketTwoWayStream` with `SKIP_ACE`
  enabled.
* Added implementation of `SystemInfo` for macOS.
* Fixed bug in `yarprun` currently occuring only on macOS, but potentially on
  other platforms (#633)
* `yarp plugin` command now works with `SKIP_ACE` enabled.
* Fixed UDP and MCAST on macOS (#637)

### YARP_DEV

* Fixed `yarp::dev::BatteryClient::getBatteryTemperature()`.
* Fixed memory leak in `ImplementTorqueControl`.
* Export some important classes that were erroneously not exported in the ABI.
* Fixed memory leak in `PolyDriver`.
* ControlBoardWrapper: Added checks for testing if joint number is out of bound.


### Modules

* `Rangefinder2DWrapper`: angle_increment is now obtained from the hardware
  device.
* `laserHokuyo`: added parameters max_angle and min_angle.
* `imuBosch_BNO055`: fixed use of char (a signed type) for the byte buffer that
  was corrupting positive measures when converting from 2 bytes to a single 16
  bit value.
* `fakeMotionControl`: Fix memory leak.
* `portaudio`: fix bug in number of samples recorded, changed default values to 
  have the device more responsive.


### GUIs

* `yarpview`:
  * Fixed .app bundle on macOS.
  * `QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO` is now set to "auto" to support 4k displays.
* `yarpscope`:
  * Fixed .app bundle on macOS.
  * Fixed help for --min and --max arguments.
  * Fixed reading minval and maxval from xml.
* `yarpmotorgui`:
  * Max number of joints was fixed to 16. Now memory is dynamically allocated.
  * Fixed issue preventing sequence tab to acquire encoder positions on double
    click, if the control mode of the selected joint is not POSITION.
  * Fixed bug preventing correct copy-and-paste action
  * Fixed issue preventing a GO action from being executed if timing is less
    than zero.
  * Allow copying single lines to clipboard from sequence tab.
  * `QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO` is now set to "auto" to support 4k displays.
  * Added box to display openloop output.
* `yarpdataplayer`
  * `QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO` is now set to "auto" to support 4k displays.
  * Fixed error when opening readonly files.
  * Fixed variable sample rate data playing too fast.
* `yarplogger`:
  * The date is now taken into account.


### IDLs

* The script executed by RosTypeSearch::fetchFromRos now supports the creation
  of .msg files in a non-existing directory.


### Bindings

* Properly define TypedReaderCallbackSound (Fixes TypedReaderCallbackImageMono
  redefinition).

### Build System

* `YarpPlugin.cmake` no longer redefines the `FIND_PACKAGE` CMake command.
