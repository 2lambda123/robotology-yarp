\section desc Description
This example demonstrates how to simply use the port monitor carrier to modify data going through a connection. The port '/write' from 'yarp write' module is connected to the '/read' port of 'yarp read' using a portmonitor plugged into the receiver side. The portmoniotr loads dll (\c 'libsimple_monitor.so') in which we access and modify the data going through through the port.
