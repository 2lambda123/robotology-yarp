This directory is reserved for examples of the use of YARP and related
libraries.

* hello

    Writes "hello world", with a small delay between the words.
    Just to test that the YARP library can be found.

* ace_check

    A project that doesn't use YARP at all, just to test that
    ACE is correctly set up.  Contains the FindAce macro, and stripped
    down versions of some of YARP's clases.

* dev_check

    Tests the YARP factories for producing interfaces to 
    device drivers.
    
* property

    Reading config files and command line arguments in a way
    that is compatible with configuring drivers and sending 
    network messages.
