This directory is for producing SWIG interfaces to YARP.

We just try Java for now.  To create the Java interface to YARP from linux
(the process on windows is analogous using cmake):
  ccmake .   # make sure the Java JNI directories get found
  make
You should end up with a "jyarp.so" library and a lot of generated "*.java"
files in a directory called "generated_src".
There will be a LOT of warnings during this process.  That is normal.

Now either do something like one of:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Or move jyarp.so into a directory in your library path.

Now try building the examples using ant by typing:
  ant

You should now have files like "example1.jar" in the bin directory.
The source for these examples is in the "src" directory.

Try running:
  java -jar bin/example1.jar
and see if stuff happens.
