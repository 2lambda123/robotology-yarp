This directory is for producing SWIG interfaces to YARP.

============================================================================
== JAVA INTERFACE

To create the Java interface to YARP from linux
(the process on windows is analogous using cmake):
  ccmake .   # make sure the Java JNI directories get found
  make
You should end up with a "libjyarp.so" library and a lot of generated "*.java"
files in a directory called "generated_src".
There will be a LOT of warnings during this process.  That is normal.

Now either do something like one of:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Or move libjyarp.so into a directory in your library path.

Now try building the examples using ant by typing:
  ant

You should now have files like "example1.jar" in the bin directory.
The source for these examples is in the "src" directory.

Try running:
  java -jar bin/example1.jar
and see if stuff happens.


============================================================================
== PYTHON AND PERL INTERFACES

Run:
  ccmake .
And set "CREATE_PERL" and/or "CREATE_PYTHON" to true.
Run:
  make

You should now have libraries called libyarp.so and/or _yarp.so

Now try to run example.pl and/or example.py


============================================================================
== CHICKEN INTERFACE

Run:
  ccmake .
And set "CREATE_CREATE" to true.
Run:
  make

You should now have cyarp.so and cyarp.scm

Now try:
  chicken cyarp.scm
  chicken example.scm && gcc example.c cyarp.c cyarp.so -lchicken -o example
  ./example
