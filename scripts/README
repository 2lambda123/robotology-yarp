The scripts in this directory are for maintaining the YARP repository.
They are not part of YARP itself.  So if you are not a maintainer of YARP,
you don't need to care about them.

Someday they will disappear from here and go somewhere more discreet.

+ Unless otherwise specified, all scripts should be run from LINUX only.

+ Always run the script from $YARP_ROOT (one directory up) as:
    ./scripts/script-name

+ If you do not know what a script does, run it on a separate
  checkout of the repository.  It could do ANYTHING.

MOST OFTEN USED SCRIPTS:

./scripts/update-automake
	synchronizes build files for autoconf and automake

./scripts/update-headers
	uses emacs to regularize indentation of all source files

./scripts/make-source-package
	Uses cvs to check out a clean copy of YARP, and 
	generates a source package using cmake.
	Works in a subdirectory, $YARP_ROOT/source-package

	If you have to run it a few times in a row, you can do:
          ./scripts/make-source-package nocvs
	to avoid cvs being called each time.
