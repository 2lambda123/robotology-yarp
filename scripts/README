The scripts in this directory are for maintaining the YARP repository.
They are not part of YARP itself.  So if you are not a maintainer of YARP,
you don't need to care about them.

Someday they will disappear from here and go somewhere more discreet.

+ Unless otherwise specified, all scripts should be run from LINUX only.

+ Always run the script from $YARP_ROOT (one directory up) as:
    ./scripts/script-name

+ If you do not know what a script does, run it on a separate
  checkout of the repository.  It could do ANYTHING.

MOST OFTEN USED SCRIPTS:

./scripts/update-automake
	synchronizes build files for autoconf and automake

./scripts/update-headers
	uses emacs to regularize indentation of all source files

./scripts/make-source-package
	Uses cvs to check out a clean copy of YARP, and 
	generates a source package using cmake.
	Works in a subdirectory, $YARP_ROOT/source-package

	If you have to run it a few times in a row, you can do:
          ./scripts/make-source-package nocvs
	to avoid cvs being called each time.

How to make a YARP release:
--------------------------

* Be on a linux machine, ideally debian or ubuntu or along those lines

* Look at this page to get the current YARP version, say 2.1.6:

  http://eris.liralab.it/yarp/specs/dox/download.html

* Check that all the regression tests listed on that page are passing.
  If they look old, you may need to kick the regression virtual
  machines; they get powered down randomly from time to time.

* For practice, run:

  ./scripts/check-public-version.sh 2.1.6

* That checks that everything in the public version compiles ok.

* Make sure that conf/YarpVersion.cmake is different to the latest
  public version, bumping up the version number if needed.

* To update shadow autoconf/automake file, from $YARP_ROOT run:

  ./scripts/update-automake 

* Add a line to the bottom of conf/build.txt (follow the pattern) and
  commit all to CVS.  This makes the test servers (re)generate zips 
  and tars for the selected version number, placing them in:
