Description: library support for YARP network of ports and devices
 Flexible communication between processes and devices spread
 across a local network.  Especially useful for inhomogeneous networks
 with a mixture of operating systems and compilers.  Originally developed
 for large-scale humanoid robot projects such as COG, Kismet, and RobotCub, 
 where many idiosyncratic devices need to be integrated into a single
 control system without there being any one OS that supports them all.
 Uses well-specified protocols across tcp, udp, shared-memory, and multicast.
