INTRODUCTION
------------

This is YARP2, a new version of the YARP robot library set.

It helps do stuff with robots (or avoid doing stuff with robots by 
spending your time writing libraries).

License and copyright information is in COPYING.

===============================================================================

STATUS
------

YARP2 is usable by brave developers.  Watch out for the following:

+ compared to YARP1, there are a lot of missing parts.  The library
  in src/libYARP_OS_compat will help if you want to mingle new and old.

+ yarp::sig::Image is a stub - it has a very bare minimum of functionality.
  You can still use YARPImage; the classes are network compatible.

+ yarp::os::Bottle doesn't have everything that YARPBottle had.  You can
  still use YARPBottle; the classes are network compatible.

+ libYARP_OS - fairly complete
+ libYARP_OS_compat - fairly complete
+ libYARP_sig - a stub
+ libYARP_sig_compat - a stub

COMPILATION and INSTALLATION
----------------------------

If you are on a debian linux system, type:

  make

If that works, type:

  make deb

There should now be installable packages in a directory called "package".
Install using:

  dpkg -i <package filename>

The packages can be deinstalled using standard debian package management.

Apart from that, we are currently lacking install documentation.  So
if you need that, you're probably better off not using this version of
YARP.

There are some project files for windows.  They assume that you have two 
environment variables set:
  ACE_INCLUDE
  ACE_LIB
pointing to include files and library files for ACE.

===============================================================================

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

If you are on a debian linux system, make sure you have "doxygen" and type:

  make dox

You should be able to browse library documentation from:

  doc/index.html
