This is YARP2, a new version of the YARP robot library set.

License and copyright information is in COPYING.

YARP2 is under development.  During this process, it will be relatively
difficult to use under Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio.  We ask 
your patience.

===============================================================================

STATUS
------

YARP2 is usable by brave developers.  Watch out for the following:

+ compared to YARP1, there are a lot of missing parts.  The library
  in src/libYARP_OS_compat will help if you want to mingle new and old.

+ yarp::sig::Image is a stub - it has a very bare minimum of functionality.
  You can still use YARPImage; the classes are network compatible.

+ yarp::os::Bottle doesn't have everything that YARPBottle had.  You can
  still use YARPBottle; the classes are network compatible.

For help, and to complain, email paulfitz@liralab.it


===============================================================================

COMPILATION and INSTALLATION
----------------------------

If you are on a debian linux system, type:

  make

If that works, type:

  make deb

There should now be installable packages in a directory called "package".
Install using:

  dpkg -i <package filename>

The packages can be deinstalled using standard debian package management.

Apart from that, we are currently lacking install documentation.  So
if you need that, you're probably better off not using this version of
YARP.


===============================================================================

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

If you are on a debian linux system, make sure you have "doxygen" and type:

  make dox

You should be able to browse library documentation from:

  doc/index.html
