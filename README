Hello, good evening, and welcome to YARP2.

This is a new version of YARP.

===============================================================================

COMPILATION and INSTALLATION
----------------------------

If you are on a debian linux system, type:

  make

If that works, type:

  make deb

There should now be installable packages in a directory called "package".
Install using:

  dpkg -i <package filename>

The packages can be deinstalled using standard debian package management.

Apart from that, we are currently lacking install documentation.  So
if you need that, you're probably better off not using this version of
YARP.
