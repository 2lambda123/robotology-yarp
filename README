QUICKSTART
----------

There are a few different ways to compile YARP2 (see below).
Probably the easiest right now is using "cmake" (see www.cmake.org).

In linux, in this directory, type:

  cmake .
  make
  make test


===============================================================================

COMPILATION and INSTALLATION
----------------------------

If you are on a debian linux system, type:

  # get hand-crafted makefiles
  # see sections below for alternative makefile sources
  make -f Makefile.man maker

If that works, type:

  make

If that works, type:

  make deb

There should now be installable packages in a directory called "package".
Install using:

  dpkg -i <package filename>

The packages can be deinstalled using standard debian package management.

Apart from that, we are currently lacking install documentation.  So
if you need that, you're probably better off not using this version of
YARP.

There are some project files for windows.  They assume that you have two 
environment variables set:
  ACE_INCLUDE
  ACE_LIB
pointing to include files and library files for ACE.

===============================================================================

AUTOCONFISCATION
----------------

Currently, we use non-autoconf-based makefiles.

But autoconf+automake support is starting to be put together.  If you
checked out from CVS and have a configure.ac file but would like to
have a configure file, try:

  # debian packages: libtool autoconf automake1.8 (version num arbitrary)
  ./bootstrap

You should now have a configure file.
Try:

  ./configure

All going well, you have some new Makefiles.  Try:

  make

===============================================================================

CMAKE
-----

Currently, we use non-cmake-based makefiles.

But cmake support is starting to be put together.  If you
checked out from CVS and have only a CMakeLists.txt file but would like to
have a makefile or visual studio project, try installing "cmake" and
then running it and following its hints.


===============================================================================

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

If you are on a debian linux system, make sure you have "doxygen" and type:

  # get hand-crafted makefiles
  make -f Makefile.man maker
  make dox

You should be able to browse library documentation from:

  doc/index.html
