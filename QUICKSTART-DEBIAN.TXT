As superuser:
  apt-get install libace-dev cmake

As normal user:
  cmake .
  cmake .  # just to be sure
  make
  make test

If that's working, try:
  ccmake .
Which gives you access to configuration options.  See "README" for details.

To compile basic GUIs, you'll need at least:
  apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

And for even more GUIs:
  apt-get install libgtkmm2.4-dev libglademm-2.4-dev

GUIs are by no means essential to YARP usage.
