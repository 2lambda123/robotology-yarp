UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Alex Bernardino, Carlos Beltran, May 2007.

This driver aims at creating an OS independent serial communications driver
(rs232) for YARP.
We exploit the capacity of ACE (Adaptive Communications Environment) to
provide serial communications. I good example directly available in the ACE
distribution can be found in: ACE_ROOT\examples\IPC_SAP\DEV_SAP\
