 * \defgroup dev_all Devices
 *
 * Dealing with devices.  What do you need to know to use devices in
 * YARP?  First, we try to write our devices so that they implement a
 * set of \link dev_iface interfaces\endlink.  Your program ideally would use
 * the minimal set of interfaces needed for the particular task you
 * have in mind.  Then you'll be later able to switch to any
 * \link dev_impl implementation \endlink that meets your interface.  This
 * is something you often have to do in robotics.
 *
 * Of course, pretty much every device has some special magic numbers
 * you need to set up at the beginning.  This process of 
 * \link dev_class configuration \endlink process is separated out in YARP
 * to make it easy to control it via external command line switches
 * or configuration files.
