/**
 * @page yarpdev The standard YARP device utility.

The command-line utility "yarpdev" can create devices and wrap 
them for network visibility.  This is useful in cases where you
wish to control devices on remote machines.

@section yarpdev_base yarpdev

The utility gives a message if called with no arguments to confirm
that it exists, and to give tips on where to get started using it.
Our current implementation says:

\verbatim
You can call yarpdev like this:
   yarpdev --device DEVICENAME --OPTION VALUE ...

   yarpdev --device test_grabber --width 32 --height 16 --name /grabber
Here are devices listed for your system:
test_grabber
remote_grabber
grabber
remote_controlboard
