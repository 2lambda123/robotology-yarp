 * @page install Installing YARP

YARP is available from http://yarp0.sourceforge.net

Here are the steps needed to install it:
  \li @subpage cmake "Install CMake"
  \li @subpage install_ace "Install ACE"
  \li @subpage install_yarp "Get YARP"
 
We suggest that, if you are a first-time user of YARP, you install
it on one or two machines first, before trying to set it up for a
cluster.
