 * @page install Installing YARP

YARP is available from http://yarp0.sourceforge.net

We suggest that, if you are a first-time user of YARP, you install
it on one or two machines first, before trying to set it up for a
cluster.

To set YARP up on a single machine:
  \li @subpage cmake "Install CMake"
  \li @subpage install_ace "Install ACE"
  \li @subpage install_yarp "Get YARP"
 
Then test your installation before moving on to
other YARP components.
