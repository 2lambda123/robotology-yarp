 * @page install Installing YARP

YARP is available from http://yarp0.sourceforge.net

We suggest that, if you are a first-time user of YARP, you install
it on one or two machines first, before trying to set it up for a
cluster.

To set YARP up on a single machine:
  \li \link cmake Install CMake \endlink
  \li \link install_ace Install ACE \endlink
  \li Compile YARP
 
Then test your installation before moving on to
other YARP components.
