 Through Me Pass into the Painful City,
 Through Me Pass into Eternal Grief,
 Through Me Pass among the Lost People.
 Justice Moved My Master-Builder:
 Heavenly Power First Fashioned Me
 With Highest Wisdom and with Primal Love.
 Before Me Nothing Was Created That
 Was Not Eternal, and I Last Eternally.
 All Hope Abandon, You Who Enter Here.

/**
 * @page what_is_yarp What is YARP?
 *
 * YARP is written by and for researchers in robotics, particularly
 * humanoid robotics, who find themselves with a complicated pile of
 * hardware to control with an equally complicated pile of
 * software. At the time of writing (2006), running decent visual,
 * auditory, and tactile perception while performing elaborate motor
 * control in real-time requires a lot of computation. The easiest and
 * most scalable way to do this right now is to have a cluster of
 * computers. Every year what one machine can do grows, but so do our
 * demands. YARP is a set of tools we have found useful for meeting
 * our computational needs for controlling various humanoid robots.
 *
 * The components of YARP can be broken down into:

 * \li \link yarp_os libYARP_OS \endlink - interfacing with the operating system(s) to support
 * easy streaming of data across many threads across many
 * machines. YARP is written to be OS neutral, and explicitly
 * supports Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX and (in some versions) the
 * QNX realtime operating system.

 * \li \link sig_class libYARP_sig \endlink - performing common signal processing tasks (visual,
 * auditory) in an open manner easily interfaced with other
 * commonly used libraries.

 * \li \link dev_all libYARP_dev \endlink - interfacing with common devices used in robotics:
 * framegrabbers, digital cameras, motor control boards, etc.

 * These components are maintained separately. The core component
 * is libYARP_OS, which must be available before the other
 * components can be used.

 * YARP has some @subpage requirements

/**
 * @page yarp_os The YARP OS library
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the YARP OS library.  This library interfaces
 * with your operating system and provides some basic services.
 * We give you
 * \link yarp::os::Thread Thread\endlink, 
 * \link yarp::os::Semaphore Semaphore\endlink, and 
 * \link yarp::os::Time Time\endlink
 * services just in case
 * you don't have them, but our main goal is to give you easy network
 * communication using the YARP 
 * \link yarp::os::Port Port\endlink
 * Network.
 * 
 * @section what_is_a_port What is a Port?
 *
 * A \link yarp::os::Port Port\endlink is an object that can read and
 * write values to peer objects spread throughout a network of
 * computers.  You can create them in your program, and then add and
 * remove connections either from that program, from the command line,
 * or from another program.
 * Ports are specialized for streaming communication, such as camera
 * images or motor commands.  You can switch network protocols for any
 * or all your connections without changing a line of code.
 * For more details, see 
 * \subpage terms "specification of YARP terms and protocols".

 *
 * For examples, see @subpage yarp_code_examples.

 * @section important_yarp_os_classes Important classes
