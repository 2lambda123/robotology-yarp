2007-02-03  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/Makefile.am: ran
	./scripts/update-automake to freshen files needed for
	the "autoconf/automake" method of compiling YARP.  
	This still just builds the libYARP_OS and libYARP_sig
	libraries.

2007-02-02  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/end_pack_for_net.h: add support
	for Intel Mac OS/X.  This file needs to be cleaned up a bit.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Companion.cpp: Assif spotted that when a port
	is registered but does not exist yet, yarp ping does not return a
	failure.  Thanks Assif!

2007-01-31  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/ffmpeg: Option to synchronize on image
	rather than audio channel for FfmegGrabber device.  This is
	useful to preserve the exact number of images in an input
	movie.

2007-01-30  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* QUICKSTART-WIN-VS6.TXT, QUICKSTART-DEBIAN: Added windows
	installation notes from Claudio Castellini (thanks!), and sketched
	debian installation procedure.

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/PortReaderBuffer.h: Corrected
	some goofs affecting Windows builds.

2007-01-27  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: Reduced port count
	from 3 to 1.  For now, "--single_port" option needs to be set
	during creation of the device in order to use this new interface.
	Don't want to surprise anyone too much.

	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/os/PortReaderBuffer.h: Put in
	a bypass for messages requiring replies (these cannot be logically
	be buffered in any useful way).

2007-01-26  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/HttpCarrier.h: Sketch how
	http interface can expose human-readable queries as forms.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: began
	changes in order to better allow controlboards to be
	queried in human-readable form.

	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/DeviceDriver.h: began
	support for human-readable device usage queries.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: added
	suppressed-reply operation, so that if a connection to an
	RPC port does not actually care about a reply, that reply
	is not sent.

2007-01-25  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: make sure
	velocity interface can be used independently of position
	interface.

2007-01-19  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/HttpCarrier.cpp: support for "post" form
	of http messages.

2007-01-17  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/BottleImpl.cpp,PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: try to
	deal with newest ACE not using -1 anymore for string methods.
	(Motivation: running YARP on MAC OSX on intel processors requires
	recent ACE beta).

2007-01-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/FallbackNameClient.cpp,Companion.cpp:
	called name server entry "/root" instead of "root" now that
	it is a real port.

2007-01-12  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: Made connections
	reversible, so that an input connection can switch to 
	become an output connection.  This is helpful for communication
	with non-YARP processes, where a connection to read data is
	initiated externally.

	* README: Updated compile/install instructions.

2007-01-11  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/HttpCarrier.h: Made basic port 
	properties visible to http connections (e.g. from web browser)

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/NameserCarrier.h: Made name server
	protocol a protocol supported at the port level.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/NameServer.cpp: Modified name server slightly
	so that it uses a real port.  All port-level protocols and tools
	can now be used to communicate with it.  In particular
	"yarp rpc /root" works.

2007-01-11  Alexandre Bernardino  <alex@isr.ist.utl.pt>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/common/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.h: 
	Added a new option (--flea) to provide support for pointgray FLEA
	cameras.
	
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/winnt/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.cpp: 
	1. Removed the hardcoded parameter initialization. 
	2. Added FLEA camera's support through a more general color 
	reconstruction method.
	
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/winnt/yarp/COPYRIGHT: 
	Original copyright for the Bayer2RGB color reconstruction method 
	from OpenCV.


2007-01-10  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Companion.cpp: Added "ping" and "exists"
	subcommands, to facilitate gathering information about the
	existence and properties of a port.

2007-01-09  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ffmpeg: Added --nodelay flag if realtime
	playback of movies is not required; also --loop and --noloop
	options.

2007-01-08  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: Allowed ports to
	pass on interrupt signal.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/opencv_grabber: Made driver pay attention 
	to width, height.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ffmpeg: Added FfmpegWriter as basic
	interface to ffmpeg's media writing capability.

2007-01-05  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/Contactable.h: Exposed input
	and output connection counts for Ports and BufferedPorts.

	* example/external/nameclient.cpp: Added an example of accessing
	the yarp name client using UNIX-style native tcp socket 
	interface, rather than ACE+YARP.  This was in response to
	questions from someone evaluating YARP.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/opencv_grabber: Added --loop option for
	opencv_grabber, per Alex Bernardino's suggestion.

2006-12-15  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ThreadImpl.cpp: fixed behavior of threads
	that shut down immediately.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/BottleImpl.cpp: sundry small improvements.


2006-12-12  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

2006-12-07  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/swig: Lots of small improvements - hopefully I 
	didn't break anything

2006-12-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt: device library is now
	compiled by default - but specific devices are not built
	in unless specifically asked for.  From a user's perspective,
	not much has changed, but now downstream users can rely
	on libYARP_dev and yarpdev existing.

2006-12-01  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/swig/yarp.i: updated to remove a new function clash

	* example/swig/FindJNI.cmake: updated by Assif to work on
	Ubuntu.

	* conf/FindPortAudio.cmake: contribution from Hatice to get 
	portaudio driver working under Windows

2006-11-30  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dimax_u2c: driver contributed by 
	Assif Mirza

	* example/dev/fake_motor.cpp,simple_motor_client.cpp: examples
	to help with developing new motor control devices
	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Companion.cpp: added some more troubleshooting
	information to "yarp check"

2006-11-27  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Several OSX fixes added -- the usual small problems related to
	ace header file order
	
	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/NetInt32.h: added operator++ and
	operator-- to big-endian implementation of NetInt32 (for OSX PPC).
	
	* automake Makefile.am files updated using scripts/update-automake.  
	This fixed bug #1601656.
	
	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Terminator.cpp: added unregister for
	fake "quit" port, fixing bug #1595763.
	
	* conf/YarpDevice.cmake, conf/yarpdev.cpp.in, 
	conf/yarpdev_helper.cpp.in: began to develop better support for
	device compilation outside of libYARP_dev.
	
2006-11-17  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpVersion.h: bumped version up to 2.1.2

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/ShmemTwoWayStream.h: removed
	some YARP1 cruft and increased the default buffer size.

2006-11-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/jrkerr: IST checked in a windows Jrkerr
	motion controller.

2006-11-14  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* experimental support for single-threaded yarpdev

2006-11-08  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt: fix from Assif for wrong
	GLOB.
	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/UserDoc.dox: inserted
	some important missing info into the howto.

	spaces are OK.  Fixes bug 1582945.

2006-10-07  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Bugfix - PortReaderBuffer was not always returning 
	messages in the right order, oops!

2006-09-14  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Integrated with ffmpeg for reading audio/visual material

	* Bugfix for sound network format

	* C# swig interface tested (added to Java, Perl, Python, ...)

2006-09-01  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Fixed bug where non-buffered Port closed with data pending 
	would wait for that to get read

	* Fixed ports so you can open and close them repeatedly

	* Made some Solaris fixes - YARP works there now!

	* Integrated opencv_grabber

	* Added in some docs developed for summer school

2006-08-24  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Bumped version up to 2.0.7

	* Started portaudio device wrapper -- seems a good library
	for doing cross-platform audio

2006-07-28  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Fixed some problems picked up at summer school.
	Including: representation of doubles on Mac OSX
	(thanks Anthony Truchet!); buffering default for
	BufferedPort set to lossy (thanks to lots of people);
	no longer permit multiple connections between
	a single source-target port pair; set orientation
	in IPL structure associated with images.

2006-07-14  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Fixed some problems that valgrind picked up.  The
	biggest was a mismatched constructor/destructor for an
	class derived from ACE in PortCorePacket.h.

2006-07-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Finally dealt with silly CR/LF issues so that telnet
	access to yarp ports and the name server is less painful
	on Windows.

	* Making Bottle a better behaved recursive data structure (an
	s-expression in disguise).

2006-06-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Added Port::setReaderCreator so users can have persistent
	readers for each port input.

2006-06-02  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Added missing Thread::isRunning method.
