2007-07-06  Alessandro Scalzo <alessandro@liralab.it>
	* src/yarp/libYARP_os/include/yarp/os/Run.h
	* src/yarp/libYARP_os/src/Run.cpp
	New version, supports run & kill processes
	on both unix and win32. Does not support
	IO (by now).
	
2007-06-27  Jonas Ruesch  <ruesch@ifi.uzh.ch>

	* example/swig/yarp.i:
    support for ImageOf<PixelFloat> added.
    * example/swig/src/YarpImageHelper.java
    method get2DMatrix(ImageFloat img) added. 

2007-06-18  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/CmakeLists.txt, conf/YarpReqLib.cmake, src/yarp-framegrabbergui: 
	removed GtkMM dependency

2007-07-04  Lorenzo Natale <nat@liralab.it>

	* conf/CMakeLists.txt
	* conf/YARPCompileModules.txt
	* src/yarpdev/CMakeLists.txt
	External modules support. CMake was not setting dependencies
	between libraries correctly (build all failed if external libs
	were not manually compiled beforehand). Now fixed.

2007-06-05  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/LocalCarrier.h: improvements
	to local carrier shutdown procedure.

2007-06-04  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpVersion.cmake: froze version 2.1.5

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Property.cpp: make an exception to
	the processing of backslash symbols when reading command
	line options, to make it easier for Windows people to
	pass filenames.

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/ShmemCarrier.h: don't use
	member templates, Visual Studio 6 unhappy.

2007-06-01  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/ShmemHybridStream.h: switched
	"shmem" carrier to be a name for Alessandro's new
	implementation.  To get the old carrier, use "shmem1".
	So something like "yarp write /write shmem://read" will
	connect using the new shmem implementation from today.

2007-05-29  Alessandro Scalzo <ale@liralab.it>
	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/ShmemHybridStream.h, 
	src/libYARP_OS/src/ShmemHybridStream.cpp: added a new
	two way communication stream based on shared memory.
	Synchronization obtained by socket. It has the same
	interface as ShmemTwoWayStream. Now adapts the
	buffer size at runtime. Tested.

2007-05-28  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpCompileModules.cmake: modify Lorenzo's method
	for adding external modules into libYARP_dev so that it
	can also be used to compile modules completely outside
	of the YARP library (a bit like kernel modules).
	Updated "yarp cmake" cmake file to reflect these changes.

2007-05-25  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/LocalCarrier.h: new and better
	implementation of the "local" carrier.  If ports are running as
	part of the same process, and are attached to each other using the
	"local" carrier, then serialization never needs to happen --
	direct object references are passed around instead.  This works
	particularly well for BufferedPorts, since these can manage
	details such as keeping "written" objects around untouched until
	all readers have finished working with them.  This carrier should
	be considered experimental for now.

2007-05-21  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* conf/YarpAddExternalModules: multiple devices 
	can now be listed in each device directory, 
	module name gets propagated to cmake flag variable
	to avoid clashes.

2007-05-21  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/ShmemCarrier.h, 
	src/libYARP_OS/include/src/Carriers.cpp: told YARP about
	ale's new carrier, called it "shmem2" for testing purposes.

2007-05-21  Alessandro Scalzo <ale@liralab.it>
	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/ShmemHybridStream.h, 
	src/libYARP_OS/src/ShmemHybridStream.cpp: added a new
	two way communication stream based on shared memory.
	Synchronization obtained by socket. It has the same
	interface as ShmemTwoWayStream.

2007-05-17  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortReaderBuffer.cpp: There was a bug that
	would in some cases let a port overwrite a message currently being
	accessed by the user of the port (thanks to Jonas Ruesch for
	reporting problem).

2007-05-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_sig/include/yarp/sig/all.h: removed automatic
	include of IplImage.h -- clashes with opencv in some cases,
	and should be unnecessary.  Closes bug #1720180 (thanks to
	Jonas Ruesch for reporting problem).

2007-05-14  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/firewirecamera:
	new device, video streaming from firewire bus.

2007-05-14  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/esdMotionControl: 
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/James:
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/XSensMTx: 
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/inertiacube2:
	code removed. It is now placed in platform specific modules.

2007-05-10  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt: use TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES
	instead of LINK_LIBRARIES so that external dependencies
	propagate correctly to any other subprojects using the device 
	library (src/yarp-framegrabbergui seems to currently need this).

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ThreadImpl.cpp: bugfix - join was no
	longer being called in some situations due to changes made 
	for bug #1695724. This gave a memory leak, first noticed
	in the yarp name server.
	
2007-04-23  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/harness/ModuleTest.cpp: fix for the usual mac +
	ACE header file order issue.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/IConfig.cpp: fix for the usual mac + ACE
	header file order issue.

2007-04-12  Lorenzo Natale <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt
	* conf/YarpAddExtModule.cmake
	* example/externalmodules
	Initial support for adding external devices to YARP.

2007-04-10  Jonas Ruesch  <ruesch@ifi.unizh.ch>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/urbtc/linux/yarp/UrbtcControl.cpp:
        short overflow bugfix + compile warning fixes.

2007-04-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ThreadImpl.cpp: Added fix for bug #1695724.

	* src/libYARP_OS/harness/ThreadTest.cpp: Added regression test
	for bug #1695724 -- Thread::isRunning() not returning correct
	values in some situations.

2007-04-03  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpVersion.cmake: freezing version 2.1.4

	* COPYING: freshen author and licensing information using
	./scripts/update-license

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ShmemTwoWayStream.cpp: added message
	about occasional bad shared memory / hostname configuration 
	interaction problem.  If a shared memory connection fails, the
	following message is shown:
          *** Shared memory connection failed
          Shared memory connections can fail due to a network configuration 
	  problem.  There is a check to make sure shared memory connections 
	  are local, and this check relies on your hostname being configured 
	  well. Possible fixes:
	  - On linux, edit /etc/hosts to link 127.0.0.1 with your hostname
          - (you can find out your hostname with the "hostname" command)
          - On a windows laptop, make sure you have a network card attached
          For up to date information, see mailing list linked on yarp0.sf.net
	Hopefully we'll be able to solve this problem soon, but it has
	been around a long time (inherited from ACE).


2007-03-28  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/swig/yarp.i: applied patches from Boris Duran to
	fix up methods in ControlBoardInterfaces such as IPositionControl
	that don't get translated well due to use of pointers.
	Motor control from Matlab is now working on fakebot at least :-).

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/BottleImpl.h: applied patch from
	Tomassino Ferrauto to make copies a little bit less 
	inefficient.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/ControlBoardInterfacesImpl.inl: propagated 
	return values for a bunch of methods.

2007-03-27  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpReqLib.cmake: turned "-Wall" on by default for
	UNIX, rather than just when YARP_ADMIN is set.

2007-03-27  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Thread.cpp: fixed bug, onStop()
	was not called properly.

2007-03-27  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_sig/Matrix.h, Vector.h:
	Modified Vector and Matrix classes to include internal
	compatibility with the GSL library. Vector class no
	longer derives from VectorOf<double>.
	Separated read/write methods in Vector class; methods should
	now allow sending/receiving data across different architectures.
	Changed regression tests accordingly.

2007-03-27  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/urbtc: added driver from Jonas Ruesch for
	iMCs01 controlboard (see http://www.ixs.co.jp/en).

2007-03-26  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_sig/src/Matrix.cpp, Vector.cpp:
	removed ACE_String_Base::append() which does not
	compile on ace 5.4. Now using operator +=.

2007-03-26  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/FindGSL.cmake: added minimal linux functionality, 
	corrected some (probably copy/paste?) references to OpenCV.

2007-03-23  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_sig: moved Rand.h, Rand.cpp to libYARP_math. 
	Moved all Vector/Matrix related functions that were previously 
	in libYARP_sig to libYARP_math.

2007-03-22  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_math: added directory structure and some initial
	files for for libYARP_math. Changed cmake files accordingly..
	For now the default is that CMake does not include the library 
	in the main project.

2007-03-21  Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_sig/src/Rand.cpp: random generation (scalar and 
	vectors)

2007-03-20  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: (and a lot of other
	files) - cleaned up doxygen tags

	* src/doc: move dispersed doxygen files here, and rationalize
	their names.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Module.cpp: show configuration parameters
	when started up from console.

2007-03-19  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_sig/src/Vector.cpp: Lorenzo fixed a bug,
	the size() method was not working consistently.

2007-03-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/DgramTwoWayStream.cpp: crc mistreated
	in 64-bit linux.  Follow-up on sourceforge bug 1682155.

	* src/libYARP_sig/src/IplImage.cpp: applied 
	fix for compile error in 64-bit linux [sourceforge bug 1682155].
	Bug report and fix provided by Marco Barbosa.

2007-03-12  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Network.cpp: added constructors and destructors.
	On Windows, there was a potental problem when Ports are created 
	in the main() method, and destroyed after the call to Network::fini()
	without first closing the ports.  The symptom is Yarp scanning for 
	a connection to the name server on shutdown.
	This problem can be avoided by creating ports in a sub-method
	or sub-scope.
	Another possible way to avoid this problem is to replace calls
	to Network::init and Network::fini with an object declaration:
	    Network yarp;
        Make sure this object is declared before any ports.  That way
	it should go out of scope after them.  It calls Network::init
	in its constructor and Network::fini in its destructor.
	This scoping behavior may or may not be guaranteed, I haven't 
	checked that yet.

	* src/libYARP_OS: added IConfig and Module classes; these are
	experimental generalizations of devices.  They are incomplete
	and may be withdrawn or modified - use with caution.

2007-03-08 Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* example/gsl_example: contains examples of how to use GSL with
	yarp Matrix and Vector classes.
        
	* example/matrix: contains examples of how to use Matrix and
	Vector classes.

2007-03-07 Lorenzo Natale  <nat@liralab.it>

	* conf/FindGSL.cmake: added for finding GSL library, the
	GNU Scientific Library

2007-03-07 Lorenzo Natale <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARPsig: added Matrix and Vector classes
	
2007-03-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/FindGtkPlus.cmake: Make sure pkg-config is loaded on
	linux if available.

2007-02-28  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/NameServer.cpp: Name server port now 
	produces output when ports are registered/unregistered, you
	can do "yarp read ... /root" to eavesdrop.

2007-02-27  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/tutorial: This example is a simple simulation of a 
	pan/tilt robot head, with simulated vision, and motor control.

2007-02-22  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/yarp-imageviewer/gCamView.cpp: Reduce verbosity of 
	yarpview program; now it prints messages to the console
	only when things go wrong, now when they are going right.

2007-02-17  Alexandre Bernardino  <alex@isr.ist.utl.pt>

	* conf/FindAce.cmake: Added specific rules for linking with MinGW:
	-lwinmm -lwsock32

2007-02-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Terminator.cpp: registered terminator
	sockets in a way that distinguishes them from ports.

	* src/doc/cmd_*.dox: freshened the documentation of the basic
	yarp programs (yarp, yarpdev, yarpview).

2007-02-15  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/NameServer.h: add a new "yarp name
	gc" command.  This does garbage collection for port names.  Every
	port for which "yarp exists /portname" returns false gets removed.
	This will clean up port information registered by processes which
	were interrupted without unregistering those ports.

2007-02-14  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/port_power, src/doc/port_expert.dox: extend
	tutorial material

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/Companion.h: added a new
	"yarp wait /portname" command.  Replicates the functionality
	Assif Mirza has been implementing with a bash script.  This
	command waits until "yarp exists /portname" is true.  It is
	currently implemented using polling.

2007-02-13  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/swig/CMakeLists.txt: Conditional for MINGW added
	for Java, based on feedback from Nelson Goncalves.  Not sure
	if it works, but should do no harm and it alerts the user to 
	the issue: passing "--add-stdcall-alias" to the linker.

2007-02-13  Giorgio Metta  <pasa@liralab.it>

	* example/gtkmm: example glade application "hello world"-like
	completed and CMakeLists files updated for Windows/Linux.

2007-02-12  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/DeviceGroup.h: new device
	called "group" that lets you start a list of devices as a group.
	There may be cross-references between the devices.  See
	src/libYARP_dev/harness/group_basic.ini for a (fairly trivial)
	example.

	* conf/FindGtkMM.cmake: added basic unix support (via pkgconfig)

2007-02-09  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* example/swig/yarp.i: wrong header file order.

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/Bottle.h: give public
	access to binary form of bottles.

	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/PolyDriver.h: add
	reference-counting to PolyDrivers.

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt: add unit testing
	to libYARP_dev - now that fake devices are available, 
	at least partial automated testing should be easier.

2007-02-08  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/doc/port_expert.dox: started documenting some of the 
	deeper port stuff.

	* CMakeLists.txt: added simple (unix-only) "dox" target for
	doxygen documentation.

2007-02-07  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp,PortCoreOutputUnit.cpp:
	Francesco Nori reported a problem that was caused by the 
	change on 2007-01-26 that adds information about whether replies
	are expected to a message.  In some configurations this change
	was not compatible with communicating with older YARP processes.
	Should be fixed now.

2007-02-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* configure.ac: added core libYARP_dev library to autoconf build,
	along with the yarpdev program.

2007-02-06 Lorenzo Natale <nat@liralab.it>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/winnt/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.cpp:
	corrected erratic behavior on setGain/setShutter/setBrightness and
	corresponding getters.
	
	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/FrameGrabberInterfaces.h: 
	added getWhiteBalanceMethod to IFrameGrabberControl and changes
	propagated to the following files -	
	- src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/ServerFrameGrabber.h
	- src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/RemoteFrameGrabber.h
	- src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/winnt/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.cpp
	- src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/common/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.h

2007-02-03  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/Makefile.am: ran
	./scripts/update-automake to freshen files needed for
	the "autoconf/automake" method of compiling YARP.  
	This still just builds the libYARP_OS and libYARP_sig
	libraries.

2007-02-02  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/end_pack_for_net.h: add support
	for Intel Mac OS/X.  This file needs to be cleaned up a bit.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Companion.cpp: Assif spotted that when a port
	is registered but does not exist yet, yarp ping does not return a
	failure.  Thanks Assif!

2007-01-31  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/ffmpeg: Option to synchronize on image
	rather than audio channel for FfmegGrabber device.  This is
	useful to preserve the exact number of images in an input
	movie.

2007-01-30  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* QUICKSTART-WIN-VS6.TXT, QUICKSTART-DEBIAN: Added windows
	installation notes from Claudio Castellini (thanks!), and sketched
	debian installation procedure.

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/PortReaderBuffer.h: Corrected
	some goofs affecting Windows builds.

2007-01-27  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: Reduced port count
	from 3 to 1.  For now, "--single_port" option needs to be set
	during creation of the device in order to use this new interface.
	Don't want to surprise anyone too much.

	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/os/PortReaderBuffer.h: Put in
	a bypass for messages requiring replies (these cannot be logically
	be buffered in any useful way).

2007-01-26  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/HttpCarrier.h: Sketch how
	http interface can expose human-readable queries as forms.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: began
	changes in order to better allow controlboards to be
	queried in human-readable form.

	* src/libYARP_dev/include/yarp/dev/DeviceDriver.h: began
	support for human-readable device usage queries.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: added
	suppressed-reply operation, so that if a connection to an
	RPC port does not actually care about a reply, that reply
	is not sent.

2007-01-25  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/RemoteControlBoard.cpp: make sure
	velocity interface can be used independently of position
	interface.

2007-01-19  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/HttpCarrier.cpp: support for "post" form
	of http messages.

2007-01-17  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/BottleImpl.cpp,PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: try to
	deal with newest ACE not using -1 anymore for string methods.
	(Motivation: running YARP on MAC OSX on intel processors requires
	recent ACE beta).

2007-01-16  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/FallbackNameClient.cpp,Companion.cpp:
	called name server entry "/root" instead of "root" now that
	it is a real port.

2007-01-12  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: Made connections
	reversible, so that an input connection can switch to 
	become an output connection.  This is helpful for communication
	with non-YARP processes, where a connection to read data is
	initiated externally.

	* README: Updated compile/install instructions.

2007-01-11  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/HttpCarrier.h: Made basic port 
	properties visible to http connections (e.g. from web browser)

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/NameserCarrier.h: Made name server
	protocol a protocol supported at the port level.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/NameServer.cpp: Modified name server slightly
	so that it uses a real port.  All port-level protocols and tools
	can now be used to communicate with it.  In particular
	"yarp rpc /root" works.

2007-01-11  Alexandre Bernardino  <alex@isr.ist.utl.pt>

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/common/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.h: 
	Added a new option (--flea) to provide support for pointgray FLEA
	cameras.
	
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/winnt/yarp/DragonflyDeviceDriver.cpp: 
	1. Removed the hardcoded parameter initialization. 
	2. Added FLEA camera's support through a more general color 
	reconstruction method.
	
	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dragonfly/winnt/yarp/COPYRIGHT: 
	Original copyright for the Bayer2RGB color reconstruction method 
	from OpenCV.


2007-01-10  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Companion.cpp: Added "ping" and "exists"
	subcommands, to facilitate gathering information about the
	existence and properties of a port.

2007-01-09  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ffmpeg: Added --nodelay flag if realtime
	playback of movies is not required; also --loop and --noloop
	options.

2007-01-08  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: Allowed ports to
	pass on interrupt signal.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/opencv_grabber: Made driver pay attention 
	to width, height.

	interface to ffmpeg's media writing capability.

2007-01-05  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/Contactable.h: Exposed input
	and output connection counts for Ports and BufferedPorts.

	* example/external/nameclient.cpp: Added an example of accessing
	the yarp name client using UNIX-style native tcp socket 
	interface, rather than ACE+YARP.  This was in response to
	questions from someone evaluating YARP.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/opencv_grabber: Added --loop option for
	opencv_grabber, per Alex Bernardino's suggestion.

2006-12-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt: device library is now
	compiled by default - but specific devices are not built
	in unless specifically asked for.  From a user's perspective,
	not much has changed, but now downstream users can rely
	on libYARP_dev and yarpdev existing.

2006-12-01  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	ace header file order
	
	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/NetInt32.h: added operator++ and
	operator-- to big-endian implementation of NetInt32 (for OSX PPC).

	conf/yarpdev_helper.cpp.in: began to develop better support for
	device compilation outside of libYARP_dev.
	
2006-11-17  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpVersion.cmake: bumped version up to 2.1.2

	* Added in some docs developed for summer school

2006-08-24  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>
