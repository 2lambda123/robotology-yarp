2007-01-11  Alexandre Bernardino  <alex@isr.ist.utl.pt>

	* src\libYARP_dev\src\dragonfly\common\yarp\DragonflyDeviceDriver.h: 
	Added a new option (--flea) to provide support for pointgray FLEA
	cameras.
	
	* src\libYARP_dev\src\dragonfly\winnt\yarp\DragonflyDeviceDriver.cpp: 
	1. Removed the hardcoded parameter initialization. 
	2. Added FLEA camera's support through a more general color reconstruction 
	method.
	
	* src\libYARP_dev\src\dragonfly\winnt\yarp\COPYRIGHT: 
	Original copyright for the Bayer2RGB color reconstruction method from OpenCV.


2007-01-10  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/Companion.cpp: Added "ping" and "exists"
	subcommands, to facilitate gathering information about the
	existence and properties of a port.

2007-01-09  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ffmpeg: Added --nodelay flag if realtime
	playback of movies is not required; also --loop and --noloop
	options.

2007-01-08  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/PortCoreInputUnit.cpp: Allowed ports to
	pass on interrupt signal.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/opencv_grabber: Made driver pay attention 
	to width, height.

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ffmpeg: Added FfmpegWriter as basic
	interface to ffmpeg's media writing capability.

2007-01-05  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/Contactable.h: Exposed input
	and output connection counts for Ports and BufferedPorts.

	* example/external/nameclient.cpp: Added an example of accessing
	the yarp name client using UNIX-style native tcp socket 
	interface, rather than ACE+YARP.  This was in response to
	questions from someone evaluating YARP.

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/opencv_grabber: Added --loop option for
	opencv_grabber, per Alex Bernardino's suggestion.

2006-12-15  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_OS/src/ThreadImpl.cpp: fixed behavior of threads
	that shut down immediately.

	didn't break anything

2006-12-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* src/libYARP_dev/CMakeLists.txt: device library is now
	compiled by default - but specific devices are not built
	in unless specifically asked for.  From a user's perspective,
	not much has changed, but now downstream users can rely
	on libYARP_dev and yarpdev existing.

2006-12-01  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	portaudio driver working under Windows

	* src/libYARP_dev/src/dimax_u2c: driver contributed by 
	Assif Mirza

	information to "yarp check"

	* Several OSX fixes added -- the usual small problems related to
	ace header file order
	
	* src/libYARP_OS/include/yarp/os/NetInt32.h: added operator++ and
	operator-- to big-endian implementation of NetInt32 (for OSX PPC).

	fake "quit" port, fixing bug #1595763.
	
	* conf/YarpDevice.cmake, conf/yarpdev.cpp.in, 
	conf/yarpdev_helper.cpp.in: began to develop better support for
	device compilation outside of libYARP_dev.
	
2006-11-17  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* conf/YarpVersion.h: bumped version up to 2.1.2

	* Added in some docs developed for summer school

2006-08-24  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	a single source-target port pair; set orientation
	in IPL structure associated with images.

	biggest was a mismatched constructor/destructor for an
	class derived from ACE in PortCorePacket.h.

2006-07-06  Paul Fitzpatrick  <paulfitz@alum.mit.edu>

	* Finally dealt with silly CR/LF issues so that telnet

	readers for each port input.
